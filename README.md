# AI Deal Agent

AI Deal Agent is a full-stack prototype for an AI-assisted product search and deal recommendation tool.

Current version: v1.0

The goal is to let a user describe what they are looking for in natural language, and then return relevant product suggestions with prices, images, match scores, badges, and explanations.

Example search:

```txt
robotstøvsuger med moppe og høj sugeevne
```

The system will try to understand:

```txt
Product type: robotstøvsuger
Required features: moppe, høj sugeevne
Max price: not specified
```

It then searches for products, scores them, and presents the results in a webshop-like interface.

## How It Works

The application follows this flow:

```txt
User search text
        ↓
Requirements parser
        ↓
Product search
        ↓
Cache check
        ↓
SerpAPI call if explicitly allowed
        ↓
Product scoring
        ↓
Badges and explanations
        ↓
Frontend product cards
```

Saved searches follow this flow:

```txt
Completed search
        ↓
Save search
        ↓
Store query, parsed requirements, result count and best score
        ↓
Show saved searches in frontend
        ↓
Reuse, run again or delete saved search
```

---

## Backend Setup

Install Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a `.env` file in the project root.

Use `.env.example` as a template:

```txt
SERPAPI_API_KEY=your_serpapi_key_here
ALLOW_LIVE_SEARCH=false
CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173,http://127.0.0.1:5173
```

Do not commit `.env` to GitHub.

Start the backend:

```bash
uvicorn app.api:app --reload
```

The API will run at:

```txt
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

Swagger/OpenAPI documentation is available at:

```txt
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
```

---

## Frontend Setup

Go to the frontend folder:

```bash
cd frontend
```

Create a `.env` file inside the `frontend` folder.

Use `frontend/.env.example` as a template:

```txt
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the frontend:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend will run at:

```txt
http://localhost:5173
```

---

## Local Development

For local development, run the backend and frontend in two separate terminals.

### Terminal 1: Backend

From the project root:

```bash
uvicorn app.api:app --reload
```

### Terminal 2: Frontend

From the project root:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Then open:

```txt
http://localhost:5173
```

For normal development, keep live search disabled:

```txt
ALLOW_LIVE_SEARCH=false
```

Use cached searches while developing. Only enable live search when you intentionally want to spend a SerpAPI request.

To allow a new live search, both conditions must be true:

```txt
ALLOW_LIVE_SEARCH=true
```

and the frontend checkbox must be enabled:

```txt
Tillad live-søgning hvis cache mangler
```

After testing live search, set `ALLOW_LIVE_SEARCH` back to `false`.

---

## API Usage

### Product Search

The main search endpoint is:

```txt
POST /api/search
```

Example request:

```json
{
  "query": "robotstøvsuger med moppe og høj sugeevne",
  "allow_live_search": false
}
```

Example response structure:

```json
{
  "query": "robotstøvsuger med moppe og høj sugeevne",
  "count": 40,
  "used_cache": true,
  "requirements": {
    "product_type": "robotstøvsuger",
    "max_price": null,
    "required_features": [
      "moppe",
      "høj sugeevne"
    ]
  },
  "products": [
    {
      "product": {
        "name": "Example product",
        "price": 3999,
        "url": "https://example.com",
        "image_url": "https://example.com/image.jpg",
        "rating": 4.5,
        "source": "Example Store"
      },
      "score": 75,
      "badges": [
        "Stærkt match",
        "Høj rating"
      ],
      "explanations": [
        "✓ Rating fundet (4.5)",
        "✓ Matcher krav: moppe"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Saved Searches Endpoints

```txt
GET /api/saved-searches
POST /api/saved-searches
DELETE /api/saved-searches/{saved_search_id}
```

Example save search request:

```json
{
  "query": "robotstøvsuger med moppe og høj sugeevne",
  "result_count": 40,
  "best_score": 75
}
```

Example saved search response:

```json
{
  "saved_search": {
    "id": "example-id",
    "query": "robotstøvsuger med moppe og høj sugeevne",
    "product_type": "robotstøvsuger",
    "max_price": null,
    "required_features": [
      "moppe",
      "høj sugeevne"
    ],
    "result_count": 40,
    "best_score": 75,
    "created_at": "2026-05-13T10:00:00+00:00"
  }
}
```

## Cache and Live Search

SerpAPI has a limited number of searches per month, so the project uses local caching.

The backend checks the cache first:

```txt
If cached result exists:
    use cache

If cache does not exist and live search is not allowed:
    return an error

If cache does not exist and live search is allowed:
    call SerpAPI and save the response to cache
```

There are two layers of protection.

### 1. Environment Variable

```txt
ALLOW_LIVE_SEARCH=false
```

This prevents new SerpAPI calls globally.

### 2. Frontend Checkbox

The frontend has a checkbox:

```txt
Tillad live-søgning hvis cache mangler
```

A live SerpAPI call is only made when:

```txt
ALLOW_LIVE_SEARCH=true
```

and the frontend request sends:

```json
{
  "allow_live_search": true
}
```

This prevents accidental API usage during development.

---

## Saved Searches

The application supports saved searches.

A saved search includes:

- Unique id
- Query text
- Parsed product type
- Maximum price
- Required features
- Result count
- Best score
- Creation timestamp

Saved searches are stored locally in:

```txt
data/saved_searches.json
```

The `data/` folder is ignored by Git because it contains runtime data.

The saved search feature currently supports:

- Saving a search
- Listing saved searches
- Reusing a saved search in the search input
- Running a saved search again
- Deleting a saved search
- Preventing duplicate saved searches
- Sorting saved searches newest first

The relevant backend logic is located in:

```txt
app/saved_searches.py
```

The relevant frontend component is located in:

```txt
frontend/src/components/SavedSearchesPanel.tsx
```

---

## Product Scoring

Products are scored based on:

- Price
- Rating
- Required feature matches

The score is capped at 100.

The scoring logic is located in:

```txt
app/scorer.py
```

---

## Feature Matching

Feature matching is handled in:

```txt
app/feature_matcher.py
```

The matcher supports simple Danish/English synonym matching.

Examples:

```txt
trådløs → wireless
vandtæt → waterproof
støjsvag → quiet
usb-c → usb c, usbc, type-c
høj sugeevne → strong suction, suction, pa
```

This makes the agent better at matching Danish user requests with English product titles.

---

## Recommendation Explanations

Each product includes explanations that describe why it received its score.

Example:

```txt
✓ Rating fundet (4.7)
✓ Matcher krav: moppe
? Ikke tydeligt om produktet matcher: høj sugeevne
```

This logic is located in:

```txt
app/explainer.py
```

---

## Product Badges

The frontend displays badges such as:

```txt
Stærkt match
Muligt match
Under budget
Høj rating
Matcher: usb-c
```

Badge logic is located in:

```txt
app/badge_generator.py
```

---

## Running Tests

Run all backend tests from the project root:

```bash
python -m pytest
```

Current test coverage includes:

- Requirements parsing
- Product scoring
- Feature matching
- Saved searches

---

## Quality Checks

Run backend tests from the project root:

```bash
python -m pytest
```

Build the frontend from the frontend folder:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```

A healthy project state should have:

```txt
Backend tests passing
Frontend production build passing
Git working tree clean
```

If the frontend build fails because of local path or sync-folder issues, run the build from the actual project folder path used by your system.

---

## Development Notes

The project is intentionally built in small layers:

1. Search input
2. Requirement parsing
3. Product search
4. Cache protection
5. Scoring
6. Explanations
7. Badges
8. Frontend presentation
9. Saved searches
10. Tests

This makes the system easier to understand, debug, and extend.

---

## Current Limitations

- Product links often point to Google Shopping rather than directly to the retailer.
- Product specifications are limited to what Google Shopping returns.
- Feature matching is still rule-based and not yet powered by an LLM.
- The search parser is simple and does not fully understand complex natural language.
- Saved searches are stored in a local JSON file rather than a database.
- There is no user login or multi-user support yet.
- There is no price history tracking yet.
- There is no production deployment yet.

---

## Possible Future Improvements

- Direct retailer link lookup
- Price history tracking
- Saved searches backed by a database
- Email or push notifications for price drops
- Affiliate link support
- LLM-based requirement parsing
- LLM-based product analysis
- Review summarization
- Mobile app
- User accounts
- PostgreSQL database
- Deployment to cloud hosting
- Admin dashboard for monitoring searches and cache usage

---
